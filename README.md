# FFXIV TTRPG System

This is an unofficial implementation of [Square Enix's FFXIV TTRPG](https://www.square-enix-shop.com/ffxivttrpg/en/index.html) for Foundry VTT. It has been developed on top of [asacolips's boilerplate](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate).
There is a "[FFXIV TTRPG Fan](https://discord.gg/6EghsJdCbS)" Discord server which you can join if you want to talk about this TTRPG system.

## Roadmap

### Rollable Attributes
When clicking next to attributes, it must roll a dice with right modifier.

### Job resources checkboxes
Some abilities could use both limitations and job resources, so there must be checkboxes for those as well.

### Pet Actors
Instead of Items, the system should use Actors for Pet (to handle Token) and owners would have a link to the actor id.
Display those on any sheet if a character setting is checked, so even a custom job can have them (currently, only Summoner).

### Augments

### Portrait data
Instead of putting everyting in the biography, there should be a space for portrait data as on official character sheets.

### Custom jobs
An option should be available to use a custom job, with a custom icon and custom color header.

### Update Wiki

### Macro to assign Abilities
Make available a tool to "learn" all abilities of a specific level for one's job

### Inline Rolls
On chat rolls, buttons for ability in chat to display damage or even automatically apply effects on target. Inspiration from PF2.
