# FFXIV TTRPG System

This is an unofficial implementation of [Square Enix's FFXIV TTRPG](https://www.square-enix-shop.com/ffxivttrpg/en/index.html) for Foundry VTT. It has been developed on top of [asacolips's boilerplate](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate).
There is a "[FFXIV TTRPG Fan](https://discord.gg/6EghsJdCbS)" Discord server which you can join if you want to talk about this TTRPG system.

## Roadmap

Everything planned as been developed. Feel free to send me a message through Discord if you have any feature request though!

## Contributing
This project is opened to PR. I am the only maintainer of this project, so please understand that you might need to send me messages on Discord if your PR does not get attention. It's entirely possible I miss notifications.
