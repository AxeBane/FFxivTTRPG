# FFXIV TTRPG System

This is an unofficial implementation of [Square Enix's FFXIV TTRPG](https://www.square-enix-shop.com/ffxivttrpg/en/index.html) for Foundry VTT. It has been developed on top of [asacolips's boilerplate](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate).
There is a "[FFXIV TTRPG Fan](https://discord.gg/6EghsJdCbS)" Discord server which you can join if you want to talk about this TTRPG system.

## Known Issues

### Inventory Glitchs
When moving around items in the inventory, if you switch two items, it will replace one in the first available position instead of switching positions.
