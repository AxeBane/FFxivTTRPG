# FFXIV TTRPG System

This is an unofficial implementation of [Square Enix's FFXIV TTRPG](https://www.square-enix-shop.com/ffxivttrpg/en/index.html) for Foundry VTT. It has been developed on top of [asacolips's boilerplate](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate).
There is a "[FFXIV TTRPG Fan](https://discord.gg/6EghsJdCbS)" Discord server which you can join if you want to talk about this TTRPG system.

## Known Issues

### Inventory Glitchs
When moving around items in the inventory, if you switch two items, it will replace one in the first available position instead of switching positions.

## Contributing
This project is opened to PR. I am the only maintainer of this project, so please understand that you might need to send me messages on Discord if your PR does not get attention. It's entirely possible I miss notifications.

## Roadmap
This is what is currently planned. Feel free to ask me for any other feature you would like to see on this project.

### Variablize css (dev finished)
Clean CSS files to use variables defined in `vars.css`, which are not always used, thus making dark/light themes usable (currently, only the dark theme is really supported).

### Attributes from Items
Making items (titles, consumables, any homebrew) have a list of attached bonuses. For example, an equipped title "Vigilant" could give +3 Viligance to a character and making it visible on the sheet (kind of "11 | 3" in two separate cells).

### Sounds (dev finished)
Adding a soundboard to the gamemaster's tools (starting quests/fates, level up, etc.)
