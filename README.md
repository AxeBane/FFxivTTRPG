# FFXIV TTRPG System

This project is a FoundryVTT custom system compatible with [Square Enix's FFXIV TTRPG](https://www.square-enix-shop.com/ffxivttrpg/en/index.html) (Â© SQUARE ENIX). There is no compendium so it is not playable without the official rulebook from Square Enix.

It has been developed on top of [asacolips's boilerplate](https://github.com/asacolips-projects/boilerplate).
